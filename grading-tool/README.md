# Introduction

The script `evaluate.py` accepts two arguments:

1. the path of the graph file
2. the path of the clustering file

and prints the objective value (normalized min-cut) achieved by the clustering.

# How to use?

To use it, run the following in command line:

`python evaluate.py {graph_path} {clustering_path}`

If everything (format, etc) is correct, the objective value will be printed. 

# Software requirement

We tested the script under:

- Python3.6
- numpy
- networkx
- pandas

Feel free to hack the source!
